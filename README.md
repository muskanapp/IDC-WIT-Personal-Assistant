## üßê Idea <a name = "Idea"></a>

This project focuses on implementing features that would make the life of the busiest working professionals easy in today's tech-savy world.
The whole project can be mainly divided under 3 umbrellas :- events, a to-do app and health focused features

The TO-DO app includes 3 features:-
- add task
- edit task
- clear task

Under the EVENTS umbrella,the following features are included:-
- Geting Google Calendar events and displaying them in the form of a table
- Productivity Analysis- Using the starting and ending time of meetings in the whole day to show a pie chart indicating the proportion of meeting hours and productive hours(total working hours - meeting hours)

The heath focussed features are as follows:-
- Integrating the app with a smart-watch and display a sleep cycle(sleeping hours while working on each project) 
- Sending timely notifications reminding the person of lunch time,sleep time etc.


## üé• Progress so far <a name = "progress_so_far"></a>

- The first umbrella which is the TO-DO app has been implemented successfully.
- Under the events' umbrella, all the features have been implemented on the dashboard.
- Integrating the app with Google API could not succeed due to authentication issues when sending a GET request to fetch the events, although the POST request works fine.
- So, rather, I have used dummy data and implemented the logic behind the pie chart for the productivity analysis.
- Sleep cycles would need data from smartwatches which would need authorization from the manufacturers, so I have rather used dummy data

## üí≠ How it works <a name = "working"></a>

- The TO-DO app uses state managament in REACT to retain the data for the tasks.
- The Google Calendar API sends a GET request to fetch all the scheduled events on the user's calendar and sends to the frontend to be displayed in the form of table
- The start and end timings of meetings are used to calculate the productive hours which is displayed in the pie chart as a percentage of the total working hours.
- The sleeping hours for each project are displayed in the form of bar graph.

## ‚õèÔ∏è Built Using <a name = "built_using"></a>
This app has been built using the MERN stack and a little bit of Flux for the front-end.

## ‚õèÔ∏è Debugging and Maintanence <a name="debugging_and_maintanence"></a>
- The integration with Google Calendars API needs to be worked upon.

##   Performance and Scalability <a name="performance_and_scalability"></a>


## ü§ì Future Work
- Notifications can be sent to the user reminding them of timely meals and breaks
- Integration of the web app with smart-watch can be a large scale future work which would need authorization from the side of manufacturers
- A small feature in the to-do app to set the priority of tasks (low,medium,high)
- A voice assistant service which works to play music, read out the news etc.\
